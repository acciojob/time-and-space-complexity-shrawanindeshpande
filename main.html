<h1>Time Complexity And Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time Complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm as a function of the length of the input. It is a crucial concept in computer science used to evaluate the efficiency of an algorithm.
        Understanding and analyzing time complexity helps determine how efficient an algorithm is in terms of the time it requires to process data, particularly as the size of the input grows. Efficient algorithms are those that have lower time complexity,
        meaning they require less time to complete their task as the input size increases.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of memory space an algorithm uses as a function of the length of the input. Efficient algorithms have lower space complexity, requiring less memory as the
        input size increases. For example, an algorithm with O(n) space complexity requires memory that grows linearly with the size of the input. Understanding and analyzing space complexity helps developers manage resources effectively, ensuring efficient
        memory usage within the constraints of available resources.</p>
